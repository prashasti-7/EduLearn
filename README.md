We have created a decentralized educational website where both creators who publish educational videos, and students on the platform can earn money. We have deployed Ethereum Blockchain technology as Currency to ensure secure and private transactions. Due to the immutability nature of blockchain, no change is possible on a deployed smart contract or a verified transaction. Students can earn and give anonymously. They earn NFTs on completing courses, and can earn more tokens on watching the decentralized advertisements on our website. They can utilize the earnings to give their mentors anonymously for their Courses. These tokens provide financial stability and acts as a motivation to learn further. A large percentage of ad revenue goes to the creators for their educational content. References: github.com/dappuniversity, https://www.baeldung.com/smart-contracts-ethereum-solidity
